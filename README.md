# Student Database Management System (C Program)

The Student Database Management System is a command-line C program that allows users to efficiently manage student records. The system supports adding, updating, searching, deleting, and viewing student information. Each student has a unique 6-digit Student ID, and their records are stored persistently in a file that can be accessed across multiple executions of the program.

The program stores student data in both a binary format (students.dat) and a CSV format (student_database.csv) for compatibility with spreadsheet software like Excel. Additionally, this system features a waiver calculation system that automatically calculates scholarship rates based on a student's GPA and gender, according to predefined rules.

This project is designed for educational institutions, allowing them to easily manage and track student records.


## Features

- Add Student Record:

    - Collects student information such as name, date of birth, gender, parent's names,      address, birth certificate number, GPAs, and course name.

    -   Automatically generates a unique 6-digit Student ID.

    - Validates GPA entries to ensure they are no more than 5.00.

    - Calculates a waiver percentage based on the student's GPA and gender.

    - Stores data in a binary file (students.dat) and a CSV file (student_database.     csv)     for  easy export to Excel.

- View All Student Records:

    - Displays all student records in a structured format, including details like Student ID, name, address, GPA, and waiver percentage.

- Search Student by ID:

- Delete Student Record:

    - Permanently removes a student record using the Student ID.
- Waiver Calculation:

    - Automatically calculates waiver percentages based on GPA and gender, following predefined rules.



## Project Features Included

- Unique Student ID Generation: A 6-digit unique Student ID is automatically generated for each new student to ensure no duplicates.
- CSV Export: Records are stored in both a binary file for system use and a CSV file for easy analysis in Excel.
- GPA Validation: Ensures GPA entries for HSC and SSC do not exceed 5.00.
- Waiver Calculation System: The program automatically calculates waiver percentages based on gender and GPA, simplifying scholarship tracking.
- Error Handling: The system ensures valid input for critical fields like GPA and Student ID and offers easy navigation through the menu.
- Persistent Storage: Records are stored in files, allowing access to data across multiple program executions.
